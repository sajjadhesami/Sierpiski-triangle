# Plot-Sierpi-ski-triangle
This is an implementation of the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. A description of the triangle can be found [here](). 

It uses "stddraw" and "color.py" from [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/code/).

To use the script, the number of small triangles (n) should be provided as a system argument.
